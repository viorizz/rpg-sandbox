    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p>Long ago the sun vanished and the world fell into endless night. From that darkness emerged the first sunrise—an event known as the Dawning. The realm was reborn as <strong>Dagny</strong>, meaning both "day" and "new". Yet fragments of the old night persist as dungeons that erupt with every morning light. Only those who brave these shifting labyrinths can keep the world’s rebirth alive.</p>
    <p>Four orders arose to defend the cycle of dawn: the berserkers of Solgard, the paladins of Dawntide Keep, the sorcerers of Nystara Sanctum, and the hunters of Wildsun Outpost. Their battles against the lingering bosses of night decide whether Dagny’s sunrise will continue.</p>
